# Digital Image Processing

This repository contains basic MATLAB programs related to Digital Image Processing.

The goal is to understand how image operations like grayscale conversion, black & white conversion, and channel manipulation work by writing custom functions without using built-in image processing functions like `rgb2gray` or `im2bw`.

## Contents

- Convert RGB image to grayscale manually
- Convert grayscale image to black & white using a threshold
- Remove a specific color channel (Red, Green, or Blue) from an image
- Display all results using simple MATLAB code

## Files

- `main.m` – Runs the complete program
- `toGrayscale.m` – Converts RGB image to grayscale
- `toBlackWhite.m` – Converts grayscale image to black & white
- `removeChannel.m` – Removes a selected color channel (R/G/B)
- `auto.jpg` – Sample input image

## How to Use

1. Open the files in MATLAB.
2. Make sure `your_image.jpg` is in the same folder.
3. Run `main.m` to see the results.

## Note

All operations are done without using predefined image processing functions like `rgb2gray`, `im2bw`, or `imshow`.
