# Digital Image Processing (Python)

This repository contains basic Python programs that demonstrate core digital image processing techniques by manually implementing grayscale conversion, black & white conversion, and color channel removal—**without using OpenCV’s predefined high-level functions** like `cv2.cvtColor()`.

## 🔍 Objective

To help understand how fundamental image operations work under the hood by building them from scratch using only basic NumPy operations.

---

## 🧾 Features

- ✅ Convert RGB image to grayscale manually (weighted sum of R, G, B)
- ✅ Convert grayscale image to black & white using thresholding
- ✅ Remove a specific color channel (Red, Green, or Blue)
- ✅ Display all images using `matplotlib.pyplot`
