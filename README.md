# Digital Image Processing (Python)

This repository contains basic Python programs that demonstrate core digital image processing techniques.

## 🔍 Objective

To help understand how fundamental image operations work under the hood by building them from scratch using only basic operations.

## 🧾 Features

- ✅ Convert RGB image to grayscale manually (weighted sum of R, G, B)
- ✅ Convert grayscale image to black & white using thresholding
- ✅ Remove a specific color channel (Red, Green, or Blue)
- ✅ Display all images using `matplotlib.pyplot`
- ✅ Perform Bit slicing from scratch
- ✅ Histogram Equalization
- ✅ Huffman Coding
- ✅ Shannon-Fano Coding
- ✅ Arithmetic Coding
- ✅ JPEG2000 compression
